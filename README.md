Corn or Maize Leaf Disease Detection Using CNNs:

        This repository contains a deep learning solution designed to detect and classify diseases in corn or maize leaves. Leveraging CNN-based architectures such 
        as VGG16, ResNet, and DenseNet, the project aims to enhance agricultural diagnostics by automating the identification of leaf diseases, which can 
        significantly impact crop health and yield.

Dataset Overview:

        Source: Corn or Maize Leaf Disease Dataset on Kaggle
        Description: The dataset contains images of both healthy and diseased maize leaves, categorized into multiple classes based on the type of disease. This            high-quality labeled dataset aids in building robust classification models suitable for real-world agricultural applicationsâ€‹.
        
Key Features:

        Transfer Learning: Implements pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet, DenseNet) to accelerate training and improve model performance with limited data.
        Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques to handle variability in the dataset and improve generalization.
        Model Evaluation: Provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess the performance and reliability of the trained models.
        Frameworks Used: TensorFlow and Keras for model development, along with Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data handling and                   visualization.
        
Project Workflow:

        Data Loading and Preprocessing: Handles image loading, scaling, and augmentations.
        Model Training: Fine-tunes pre-trained models for maize leaf classification.
        Evaluation and Results: Evaluates model performance using key metrics to determine optimal architecture.
        Prediction Pipeline: A ready-to-use script for testing the model with new leaf images.
